								and Applied Data Analysis</h2>
							<p>Our team of educators have years of experience teaching applied statistics and quantitative data analysis to social scientists and industry professionals. We adopt an example-based pedagogy, so that students learn how to apply the methods with real-world examples using mainstream statistical software.</p>

									<h3>Introduction to R</h3>
									<p>R is a powerful, open source, and free (as in beer!) statistical programming language increasingly used by academics, professional statisticians, and data scientists. The latest advances in quantitative methods are usually introduced to the R community as user-written packages. It can takes years before these methods become available to users of other statistical packages (or sometimes never). Becoming proficient in R can unlock a whole new door to successful data analysis. Topics covered in this session include installing and using R Studio; working with packages; loading datasets; obtaining descriptive statistics; recoding, rescaling, combining, and generating variables; plotting data; running basic regression models. Level: Beginner. No prior knowledge of R is required.</p>

									<h3>Introduction to Applied Data Analysis (Using R)</h3>
									<p>Regression is arguably the single-most important technique for data analysis. Briefly, it allows us to estimate the effect of one or more predictor variables on a continuous outcome of interest. Ordinary least squares (OLS) is a method that provides the line of best fit by minimizing the differences between the observed and predicted responses, and this course will walk you through the basics of OLS regression, as well as how to conduct this type of analysis using R. Level: Beginner to Intermediate. No prior knowledge of R is required.</p>

									<h3>Intermediate Applied Data Analysis (Using R)</h3>
									<p>When the outcome you want to model is not continuous, using OLS may lead to biased estimates. In this applied data analysis short course, you will learn how to model outcomes that are dichotomous (e.g., "yes/no"), ordinal, multinomial, event counts, etc., with a flexible class of models called Generalized Linear Models. GLMs are usually estimated with maximum likelihood (which is different than OLS) and "generalize" linear regression via a link function. Level: Intermediate to Advanced. No prior knowledge of R is required.</p>

									<h3>Introduction to Structural Equation Modelling (Using R)</h3>
									<p>SEMs are a diverse class of statistical models that include path analysis (structural model), confirmatory factor analysis (measurement model), and models with structural and measurement components. SEMs are often used to assess unobservable "latent" constructs, where items from a survey indicate unobserved variables which can then also be used to test relationships between observed and unobserved variables. SEMs can be used to test for mediation or indirect effects, as well as to simultaneously estimate complex systems of relationships (i.e., multiple outcomes of interest). Level: Intermediate to Advanced. No prior knowledge of R is required.</p>

									<span class="icon major fa-bar-chart"></span>
									<h3>Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis (Using R)</h3>
									<p>Named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, this approach allows us to express our beliefs about the true state of the world in terms of "degrees of credibility", or more formally in probabilities. Thinking about relationships in this way means that we can incorporate prior knowledge (a.k.a., "priors") into the model, which is then updated whenever new data is observed. Bayesian analysis is the process of reallocating credibility from data in a logically coherent and precise way. Bayesian inference avoids the well-documented problems associated with "null hypothesis significance testing" (e.g., see Andrew Gelman's "garden of forking paths"). Level: Intermediate to Advanced. No prior knowledge of R is required.</p>
