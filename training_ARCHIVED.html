							<h3>A Selection of Our Training Sessions</h3>

									<h3>Regression - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</h3>
									<p>Regression is arguably the single-most important technique for data 
										analysis. Briefly, it allows us to estimate the effect of one or more predictor variables on a continuous outcome of interest. OLS is a method that provides the line of best fit by minimizing the differences between the observed and predicted responses. This session is a must.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-line-chart"></span>
									<h3>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)</h3>
									<p>GLMs are a flexible class of linear regression models that allow us to model a wide range of outcomes. GLMs are usually estimated with maximum likelihood and "generalize" linear regression models via a link function. Learning how to use GLMs means that you will be able to model outcomes that are continuous, dichotomous, ordinal, multinomial, and event counts, just to name a few.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-bar-chart"></span>
									<h3>Bayesian Statistics</h3>
									<p>Named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, this approach allows us to express our beliefs about the true state of the world in terms of "degrees of credibility", or more formally in probabilities. Thinking about relationships in this way means that we can incorporate prior knowledge (a.k.a., "priors") into the model, which is then updated whenever new data is observed. Bayesian analysis is the process of reallocating credibility from data in a logically coherent and precise way. Bayesian inference avoids the well-documented problems associated with "null hypothesis significance testing" (e.g., see Andrew Gelman's "garden of forking paths").</p>
								</section>

									<span class="icon major fa-pie-chart"></span>
									<h3>Structural Equation Models (SEMs)</h3>
									<p>SEMs are a diverse class of statistical models that include path analysis (structural model), confirmatory factor analysis (measurement model), and models with structural and measurement components. SEMs are often used to assess unobservable "latent" constructs, where items from a survey indicate latent variables which can then also be used to test relationships between observed and unobserved variables. SEMs can be used to test for mediation or indirect effects, as well as to simultaneously estimate complex systems of relationships (i.e., multiple outcomes of interest).</p>
								</section>

									<span class="icon major fa-area-chart"></span>
									<h3>Multilevel or Hierarchical Modelling</h3>
									<p>Multilevel models are used for research designs in which the data for individual observations are nested within groups. A prime example of this type of research design involves the study of student achievement in educational research. Failing to account for the potential effects of the class, school, district, etc. on achievement could result in biased estimates.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-bar-chart"></span>
									<h3>Data Manipulation</h3>
									<p>For every data project, you'll find that a large portion of your time is  spent preparing the raw data for analysis; this process of data manipulation is often referred to as "data munging" or "data wrangling". Topics covered in this session include checking summary statistics; recoding, rescaling, combining, and generating variables; merging datasets; and scraping data from the Internet.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-line-chart"></span>
									<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
									<p>There's an art to presenting the results of your quantitative data analysis. Learning about the theories of visualization, you'll see first-hand what works and what doesn't. We'll show some of the major techniques necessary to help you design beautiful figures. You'll also learn how to use Plotly, Shiny, ggplot2, and Tableau.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>A Short Course in Using R (Statistical Software)</h3>
									<p>R is a powerful, open source, and free (as in beer!) statistical programming language increasingly used by academics, professional statisticians, and data scientists. The latest advances in quantitative methods are usually introduced to the R community as user-written packages. It can takes years before these methods become available to users of other statistical packages (or sometimes never). Becoming proficient in R can unlock a whole new door to successful data analysis.</p>
